# 🧟‍♂️ Zombie Typing Game – ReactJS Project

## 🚀 Overview

**Zombie Typing Game** is a beginner-friendly web game built with **ReactJS** that challenges players to type accurately and quickly to escape a chasing zombie.

This was my **first React project**, built to apply what I learned about state management, components, and game logic — and to make learning a bit more fun (and stressful 😅).

## 🕹️ How It Works

- Your character and a zombie are on a runway.  
- You're given a sentence to type.  
- The zombie keeps moving forward automatically.  
- You only move when you **type the sentence correctly**.  
- If you reach the **safe house** before the zombie catches you — you win.  
- If not... 🧟‍♀️ well, you don’t.

## 🧩 Features

- 👾 **3 Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard  
- 🎯 **Real-time feedback** while typing  
- 📊 **WPM (Words Per Minute)** and result screen after each level  
- ⚛️ Built using:
  - **React** (with hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`)  
  - **Context API + Reducer** for state management  
  - **Multiple components** for clean project structure  
  - **Custom UI** with plain **CSS**

## 🎯 Goals

This project helped me:

- Practice **state management** and **conditional rendering**
- Think through **gameplay logic** and movement
- Work with **timers** and **side effects** in React
- Design and structure a **complete front-end project**

---

## 💡 Planned Improvements

- Add an **Endless Mode** that increases difficulty over time  
- Improve **responsiveness** for mobile and all screen sizes  
- Add **animations** or **sound effects** for more immersion
