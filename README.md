🧟‍♂️ Zombie Typing Game – ReactJS Project

🚀 Overview
The Zombie Typing Game is a beginner-friendly web game built with ReactJS that challenges players to type accurately and quickly to escape a chasing zombie.

This was my first React project, built to apply what I learned about state management, components, and game logic — and to make learning a bit more fun (and stressful 😅).

🕹️ How It Works
Your character and a zombie are on a runway.

You're given a sentence to type.

The zombie keeps moving forward automatically.

You only move when you type the sentence correctly.

If you reach the safe house before the zombie catches you — you win.

If not... 🧟‍♀️ well, you don’t.

🧩 Features
👾 3 Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard

🎯 Real-time feedback while typing

📊 WPM (Words Per Minute) and result screen after each level

⚛️ Built using:

React (with hooks like useState, useEffect)

Context API with Reducer for state management

Multiple components for clean structure

Custom UI with plain CSS

🎯 Goals
This project helped me:

Practice state management and conditional rendering

Think through gameplay logic and movement

Work with timers and side effects in React

Design and structure a complete front-end project

💡 Planned Improvements
Add an Endless Mode that increases difficulty over time

Improve responsiveness for mobile and all screen sizes

Add animations or sound effects for more immersion
